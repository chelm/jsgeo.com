# jsgeo.com 
---- 

This is the source for [jsgeo.com](http://jsgeo.com). It's a static site that get's built via [acetate.io](http://acetate.io). 

To build this site there are few install steps: 

```
  git clone 
  npm install 
  npm run dev
```

Those steps run a series of npm tasks, most importantly is the build step: 

```
  # build the site into ./build
  acetate build 

  # or
  
  # build the site and open in a browser
  acatate server --open  

```

## Want to help?

I probably need more docs, but I'd love some help making the site really shine. Specifically these things: 

* A better venue map...
* Speakers need to show their Org/Affiliation and have links to thier online selves
* Anything you want... seriously, the more fun and unique this site gets, the better.
