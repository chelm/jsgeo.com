    JS.Geo is a gathering for those working with an enthusiasm for code and maps. In our three previous gatherings (in Denver, Portland, and Philadelphia) speakers included devs from organizations you know (Carto, Mapbox, Mapzen, ESRI, Cesium, IBM, etc.) as well as indie coders doing creative work outside the traditional geospatial industry. It's a single day, single track event that moves fast so as to maximize the number of interesting people and ideas.
